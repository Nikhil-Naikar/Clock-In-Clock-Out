# Clock-In-Clock-Out

# Description:
A simple Clocking In and Clocking Out application built for businesses. The purpose of this project is to practice Vue.js (components, routing, design), Java and SpringBoot (RESTful APIs, JUnit), Docker, CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins), and using AWS (EC2 instances, MySQL database).

# Design Plan:
- Build MySQL database for storing manager and workers information (name, pin, hours, pay, feedback, rating)
- Build views for different pages (login page, main page, feedback/rating page for workers, hours/pay summary page for workers, hours/pay summary page for the manager, add/remove worker page, feedback/shift rating page for manager)
- Vue.js for frontend, 
- Java and sprint boot for backend rest APIs and communication with the database
- Plan to setup CI/CD pipeline (Github, Docker, Jenkins, AWS EC2 instance) 
- Write some JUnit Tests

# Funtionalities:
